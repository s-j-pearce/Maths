## 1.0 Introduction:
Within this document, I will be looking at the methodologies and ideaolagies of some mathematical equations and terms.
## 1.1 How to calculate the greatest common divisor and the least common multiple:
### Greatest common divisor:
GCD or the greatest common divisor is the largest number that divides the given numbers. In order to calculate the greatest common divisor you must first find out all of the divisors for the given numbers. Once you have all the divisors, you will compare the two sets and find the largest divisor that is shared between the two groups.
### Least common multiple:
